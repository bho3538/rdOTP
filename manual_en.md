## Troubleshooting
1. Mobile phone OTP is unavailable or the lock screen is continuously forced to shut down due to a program error in the RDP environment\
  Even with this program, you can still use your PC without OTP when you log in directly from your local computer rather than from a remote connection (RDP).\
  After you log in locally, you can add a QR code (key change) or delete a program.
2. Even in local login, the lock screen is forcibly terminated due to a program error\
  After booting the PC into safe mode, delete the file in the following path.\
  'C:\Program Files\rdOTP\rdOTPred.dll'\
After that, you can boot the PC normally, delete the program from the control panel, and send an error report.
3. If the computer's time on the OTP authentication screen is significantly different from the actual time (based on mobile phone) (more than 1 minute)\
  Due to the nature of TOTP, if time will not sync each other, can be an error\
  In this case, you can temporarily change the mobile phone time to the computer time shown on the screen and re-run the OTP app to proceed with the login date.
